# 100daysofCVND 30daysofudacity
Updating and tracking progress for [#30daysofudacity](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/udacity-community-guide/community/30daysofudacity) and #100daysofCVND while learning Udacity [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) as part of [Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge 2019 (Facebook and Udacity)](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-phase-2/home?authuser=0)


## Day 8/30(October 07, 2019)::

> 1.Learnt about Hough transform for circles

> 2.Started learning [Dive into Deep Learning book](https://www.d2l.ai/index.html) - Introduction

> 3.Completed [WorldQuant University](https://wqu.org/programs/data-science) OOPS mini-project - coded k-means from scratch


## Day 7/30(October 06, 2019):

> 1. Learnt about Hough transform and used OpenCV to detect edges using Hough Transform

> 3. Watched MIT Self Driving Car State of the Art lecture


## Day 5/30(October 04, 2019):

**1. CVND**:

   * Learnt Canny edge detection and techniques involved: non-max suppression(thinning) and hysteresis thresholding(edge completion)

## Day 4/30(October 03, 2019):

> Digged deep in to fourier transforms and how they work? 
	Seems like there's a lot of applications to it. No wonder why Professor Gilbert Strang said that FFT is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime. There's still some things about it I don't really understand. But that's okay there's 2mrw.

   
## Day 3/30(October 02, 2019):

> **1. CVND**:

   * Learnt about low pass filters. Used OpenCV GaussianBlur function to blur brain image for reducing noise. Compared edge detection(sobel filter) on the blurred image and original image

   * Used fourier transform to visualize frequency spectrum of images and their filtered version

## Day 2/100 (October 01, 2019):

> **1. CVND**:

   * Using Fourier transforms in Numpy to find frequency distribution of images ie, the variation of intensity in images. Fourier transform TRANSFORMS images in the x-y spatial space to the frequency space
      <img src="images/2.Fourier Transform.jpg" width="640">
   * High pass filters and finding edges of images using Sobel operator in OpenCV

## Day 1/100 (September 30, 2019):

> I do herby solemnly ...

   <img src="images/1.30daysofudacity-pledge.png" width="640">

> **1. CVND**:

   * Change image background by basic image processing techniques using OpenCV
      <img src="images/1.nabhan1-space.jpg">
   
   * Day/Night image classifier on 200 images from the AMOS(Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes) dataset with an accuracy of 0.9375 by only manual feature extraction making use of HSV color-space
